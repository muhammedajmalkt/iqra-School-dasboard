### 🔐 Session Claims Example

Go to **Clerk Dashboard → Sessions → Claims**, and set:

\`\`\`json
{
  "publicMetadata": {
    "role": "{{user.public_metadata.role}}"
  }
}
\`\`\`

This sets the user role (e.g. admin, teacher, etc.) that you can access in your Next.js app via:

\`\`\`ts
const role = user?.publicMetadata.role
